Hi everyone! 

This is my first web project in Python. 

I maintain live demo under following link:

http://bmi-web-calculator-dev.eu-north-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/

If site can't be reached, you can run it locally, after checking out the repository, run following command:

    docker compose up
    
To access the application go to http://127.0.0.1:5000
